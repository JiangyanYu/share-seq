0. connect host system to container. fastq files are just simply too large to transfer to the container.
0.1 maybe also store the gtf and refgenome file in host system?
1. cat I1, I2, R1 abd R2 from multiple lanes into one file: cat xx_L001_I1_xx xx_L002_I1_xx xx_I1_xx
2. set Start=Bcl, mainly to change fastq file names, then use Fastq_Merge
2.1 or transfer fastq files Undetermined_S1_R1_001.fastq.gz (R1, R2, R3,R4) to input_files/fastqs, then use Fastq_Merge directly
3. fastq files should be stored in RawDir/fastqs
4. sample barcodes might be rc of i5 sequences

connet host input files to docker container
docker run -it --rm -v /media/agschlitzer/DATA:/home/shareseq/input_files jiangyanyu/shareseq:3.1
save gtf, refgrnome, .sh and config files in local folder
edit, config file path, rawdir, gtfPATH,refPATH accordingly
